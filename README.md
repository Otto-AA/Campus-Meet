# Campus Meet

Connecting people for spontaneous meetups at the uni campus

## Purpose

Organizing meetups with friends at university is troublesome, because every student has their unique schedule with different timeslots and different places. Especially as exchange students, with no previous friends and also completely unrelated curriculas, this app helps connecting with other students.
